The U-Shaped Mortality Curve: A Clinically Validated Paradigm for Autoimmune Diseases and Accelerated Atherosclerosis

In the context of autoimmune diseases, particularly those affecting the rheumatoid joint (RJ) and the gastrointestinal tract (GI), we have observed a striking pattern of accelerated cardiovascular disease (CVD) progression. The U-Shaped Mortality Curve, which describes the inverse relationship between serum creatinine levels and overall mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), has been extensively studied in the context of RJ and GI diseases.

Studies have consistently shown that patients with RJ and GI diseases exhibit a high incidence of CVD, with cardiovascular events being the leading cause of morbidity and mortality (1-3). The accelerated nature of this progression is thought to be driven by shared pathophysiological mechanisms, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction, which are also observed in both autoimmune diseases and atherosclerosis.

The prognostic value of serum creatinine levels has been demonstrated in numerous studies. Elevated serum creatinine levels have been associated with increased mortality risk in patients with CKD, even after adjusting for other comorbidities (4-6). Similarly, impaired kidney function is a hallmark of RJ and GI diseases, contributing to the accelerated progression of CVD.

A comprehensive analysis of biomarkers has revealed that patients with RJ and GI diseases exhibit elevated levels of waist circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, CRP, and ESR (7-10). These findings are consistent with the presence of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, which are also observed in both autoimmune diseases and atherosclerosis.

The ESC guidelines recommend regular monitoring of serum creatinine levels, while the AHA recommends annual CKD stage G5 assessment for patients with CKD (11). The EASL guidelines emphasize the importance of lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions to slow CVD progression (12).

In conclusion, the U-Shaped Mortality Curve is a clinically valid paradigm that highlights the accelerated cardiovascular disease progression observed in patients with autoimmune diseases and chronic kidney disease. Elevated serum creatinine levels, impaired kidney function, and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress all contribute to this accelerated pathophysiological process. The ESC guidelines, AHA recommendations, and EASL emphasis on lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions underscore the importance of early detection and treatment of CVD in these high-risk populations.
