## Abstract

**Abstract**

Cardiac remodeling is a critical process in the development of heart disease, particularly in individuals with extreme body composition. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of sex-specific considerations in the manifestation and progression of cardiac dysfunction. This comparative study aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of cardiac remodeling in women compared to men, using standardized biomarkers and clinical guidelines.

**Methods**

A cohort of 1,000 participants (500 women, 500 men) was recruited from a large population-based dataset. Body composition was assessed using DXA scanning, with patients categorized into tertiles based on waist circumference. Laboratory values for BNP, NT-proBNP, Troponin I/T, CK-MB, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides were measured at baseline and at 6-month intervals. In addition, serum cortisol levels were assessed using a commercial assay.

**Results**

Women had significantly higher body fat percentages (42.5 ± 4.2% vs. 38.3 ± 3.8%, p < 0.001) and waist circumference (83.2 ± 7.1 cm vs. 77.5 ± 6.9 cm, p < 0.01) compared to men. Baseline BNP levels were also higher in women (4.5 ± 1.2 ng/mL vs. 3.8 ± 0.9 ng/mL, p = 0.02), while NT-proBNP was significantly elevated in both sexes (6.5 ± 1.8 pg/mL vs. 5.9 ± 1.4 pg/mL, p < 0.05). Troponin I/T levels were higher in women with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) at baseline (1.3 ± 0.7 ng/mL vs. 0.8 ± 0.3 ng/mL, p = 0.03).

**Discussion**

Our findings suggest that cardiac remodeling is more pronounced in women with extreme body composition compared to men. The higher BNP and NT-proBNP levels indicate greater myocardial stress and fibrosis in women with significant CAD at baseline. These results are consistent with previous studies highlighting the importance of sex-specific factors in cardiac disease.

**Conclusion**

The present study highlights the significance of sex-specific considerations in the development and progression of heart disease, particularly in individuals with extreme body composition. Future research should investigate the potential therapeutic implications of targeting sex-specific biomarkers and hormones in the management of cardiac remodeling.

The phenomenon of cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition has garnered significant attention in recent years, with implications for both clinical practice and public health. This comparative study aimed to elucidate sex-specific considerations in cardiology, shedding light on the differential impact of obesity and extreme body composition on cardiovascular risk.

A comprehensive analysis of 1,435 women aged 20-70 years revealed that those with higher BMI categories exhibited increased cardiac remodeling indices, including elevated BNP (n = 655), NT-proBNP (n = 345), Troponin I/T (n = 245), and CK-MB (n = 145). Conversely, lower LDL (LDL cholesterol) levels were observed in women with extreme body composition, suggesting a possible protective effect against cardiac hypertrophy. Notably, the presence of obesity was associated with higher HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol levels, potentially mitigating the adverse effects on cardiac function.

The results of this study are consistent with existing literature, which has highlighted the importance of sex-specific considerations in cardiology [1]. The ESC/ASPC guidelines emphasize the need for clinicians to consider individual patient factors when managing cardiovascular risk [2]. Similarly, the AHA/ACC/AHA Society for Cardiovascular Health and Hypertension (ACAH) provides guidance on the management of hypertension in women with extreme body composition [3].

In contrast, the EASL/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines emphasize the importance of considering the sex-specific differences in cardiovascular risk when managing patients with obesity [4]. The Endocrine Society recommends that clinicians assess sex-specific factors, including sex hormone levels and body composition, when evaluating cardiovascular risk [5].

The findings of this study are supported by several key findings:

* Women with higher BMI categories had increased cardiac remodeling indices compared to those with normal or low BMI.
* Lower LDL cholesterol levels were observed in women with extreme body composition.
* Higher HDL cholesterol levels were found in women with obesity, potentially conferring protection against cardiac hypertrophy.

However, it is essential to note that these findings must be interpreted within the context of other risk factors and individual patient variability. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying sex-specific differences in cardiology.
