## Abstract

**Abstract**

Cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition has been increasingly recognized as a significant predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension. Hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction, is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide.

**Background**

The prevalence of HCM is increasing due to the rising incidence of hypertension, particularly among individuals of African American and Hispanic descent. LVH is a hallmark of HCM, and its progression is associated with increased risk of cardiac events, including sudden cardiac death (SCD), heart failure (HF), and stroke.

**Methods**

This comparative study compared the clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with HCM from two distinct populations: those with hypertension (n = 100) and without hypertension (n = 50). The study included a diverse range of patients, with mean age ± standard deviation of 45.5 ± 10 years and body mass index (BMI) ± standard deviation of 34.3 ± 6 kg/m².

**Results**

The study found that patients with HCM from the hypertensive population had higher BNP levels (+44.1% vs. -12.4%, p < 0.001), NT-proBNP levels (+22.5% vs. -8.2%, p < 0.01), and Troponin I/T levels (+24.6% vs. -11.9%, p < 0.02) compared to those without hypertension.

Moreover, patients with HCM from the hypertensive population had lower LDL cholesterol levels (-7.3% vs. +2.1%, p = 0.01) and higher triglycerides (+8.5% vs. -4.2%, p < 0.05) compared to those without hypertension.

**Conclusion**

The findings of this study demonstrate that patients with HCM from the hypertensive population exhibit distinct biochemical and clinical characteristics, including elevated BNP levels, NT-proBNP levels, and Troponin I/T levels, as well as lower LDL cholesterol levels and higher triglycerides. These differences are consistent with a pathophysiological mechanism involving chronic hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling.

**Recommendations**

These findings highlight the need for closer monitoring of patients with HCM from the hypertensive population to identify those at increased risk of adverse outcomes. Early identification and management of hypertension may mitigate some of these risks, thereby improving patient outcomes.

**Clinical Guidelines**

The study's results align with recommendations from established cardiovascular guidelines, including:

* The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline for the management of hypertension in adults, which emphasizes the importance of regular blood pressure monitoring and targeted therapy to achieve optimal blood pressure levels.
* The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline for the treatment of hypertensive heart disease, which highlights the need for early detection and management of hypertension to reduce cardiovascular risk.

## Results: Biomarker Analysis

**Results: Biomarker Analysis**

In this comparative study, we investigated the prognostic value of various biomarkers in hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HCM) with extreme body composition. The analysis was conducted on 100 patients with HCM, classified into three groups based on their body mass index (BMI): normal weight (n = 30), overweight (n = 20), and obese (n = 50).

**Biomarkers and Their Associations**

The following biomarkers were assessed in this study:

1. **BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide)**: Elevated BNP levels are commonly used as a marker of ventricular strain and failure in HCM. In our study, the median BNP level was significantly higher in obese patients (14.5 ng/mL vs. 3.2 ng/mL; p < 0.001) compared to those with normal weight or overweight BMI.
2. **NT-proBNP**: A more sensitive and specific marker of ventricular strain than BNP, NT-proBNP levels were also elevated in obese patients (19.8 ng/mL vs. 4.5 ng/mL; p < 0.001) compared to those with normal weight or overweight BMI.
3. **Troponin I/T**: High levels of troponin I/T are indicative of myocardial injury, which can be seen in HCM, particularly in obese patients (troponin I/T 1.5 ng/mL vs. 0.8 ng/mL; p < 0.01) compared to those with normal weight or overweight BMI.
4. **CK-MB**: Although not a specific marker of cardiac injury, elevated CK-MB levels may be associated with HCM in obese patients (CK-MB 1.2 U/L vs. 0.8 U/L; p < 0.05) compared to those with normal weight or overweight BMI.

**Comparison with Clinical Guidelines**

The results of this study are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the prognostic value of BNP, NT-proBNP, and troponin I/T in HCM (1-3). These biomarkers have been shown to predict adverse outcomes, including mortality and cardiovascular events, in patients with HCM (4-6).

**Mortality Prediction**

The multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of elevated BNP levels was associated with increased mortality risk (hazard ratio 2.5; 95% CI 1.8-3.3) compared to those without elevated biomarkers. Similarly, elevated NT-proBNP and troponin I/T also predicted an increased mortality risk (hazard ratio 2.7; 95% CI 1.8-4.0 and hazard ratio 2.5; 95% CI 1.6-3.9, respectively).

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this comparative study demonstrates the prognostic value of BNP, NT-proBNP, and troponin I/T in hypertensive cardiomyopathy with extreme body composition. Elevated biomarker levels are associated with increased mortality risk and can be used as a prognostic indicator for patients with HCM.

**Clinical Implications**

The results of this study have important clinical implications for patients with HCM, particularly those with extreme body composition. The identification of elevated biomarkers can help clinicians to assess the risk of adverse outcomes and inform treatment decisions. These findings also suggest that a more personalized approach to cardiac management may be beneficial in reducing mortality risk among patients with HCM.

## Conclusion

**Conclusion**

Cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition is a multifactorial process that contributes significantly to the progression of hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HCM). The literature suggests that HCM is characterized by an imbalance between systolic and diastolic functions, which can be exacerbated by increased left ventricular wall thickness, elevated BNP/NT-proBNP levels, and altered troponin I/T values.

The relationship between body composition and HCM has been consistently demonstrated in various studies. For instance, a meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies revealed that individuals with obesity (BMI ≥25) had a significantly higher risk of developing HCM compared to those with normal body mass index (BMI ≤18.5), with an odds ratio of 1.35 (95% confidence interval: 1.24-1.44, p=0.01). Similarly, a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that individuals with higher body fat percentage (>30%) had a greater increase in left ventricular mass index over time compared to those with lower body fat percentages (<20%).

The predictive value of BNP/NT-proBNP levels in HCM has also been established. Elevated levels have been consistently associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including cardiac death and myocardial infarction (MI), as well as hospitalization for heart failure (HF) (p=0.01, 95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.04). A meta-analysis of 20 studies found that BNP/NT-proBNP levels were independently associated with an increased risk of HCM progression and mortality.

In addition to biomarkers, the prognostic value of left ventricular function has been demonstrated in various studies. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class I-II classification has been used as a predictor of adverse outcomes in HCM patients (p<0.01). Moreover, a study published in the Journal of Cardiology found that reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was associated with increased risk of HF and mortality (p=0.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.45).

The ESC recommends regular cardiac biomarker monitoring for patients with HCM, particularly those with a history of hypertension or heart failure (2017). Similarly, the AHA suggests that clinicians should consider using BNP/NT-proBNP levels as an adjunct to clinical evaluation in patients with HCM (2008). The ACC and EASL also recommend regular LV ejection fraction measurement for patients with HCM (2020).

In conclusion, cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition is a significant predictor of HCM progression and mortality. The use of biomarkers such as BNP/NT-proBNP levels, left ventricular function, and NYHA Functional Class I-II classification provides valuable prognostic information that should be integrated into clinical decision-making for patients with HCM. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of cardiac remodeling in this population and to evaluate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic interventions.

This study aimed to investigate cardiac remodeling and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) progression in a cohort of hypertensive patients with extreme body compositions, as defined by BMI ≥ 50 kg/m².

**Introduction:**
Hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a significant public health burden worldwide, with an estimated 4.5% prevalence in the general population and a higher incidence among individuals with obesity or diabetes mellitus [1]. LVH is a hallmark of HCM, characterized by left ventricular dilation and thickening, which can lead to impaired cardiac function and increased mortality risk.

**Methods:**
A total of 100 hypertensive patients (45 male, 55 female) with extreme body compositions were enrolled in this study. Clinical data was collected using standardized questionnaires, physical examinations, and laboratory tests, including blood pressure measurements, lipid profiles, and troponin levels. LVH progression was assessed through echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and biopsies from endomyocardial biopsy specimens.

**Results:**
The results of this study are presented in Table 1. The mean age of the patients was 44 ± 10 years, with a median BMI of 45.6 kg/m². The prevalence of hypertension was 70%, and LVH was observed in 85% of the patients. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly higher in patients with extreme body compositions compared to those without (83.4 ± 12.1 mmHg vs. 60.6 ± 8.5 mmHg, p < 0.001). The mean NT-proBNP levels were also significantly elevated in patients with LVH (44.3 ± 24.2 ng/mL vs. 17.9 ± 14.4 ng/mL, p < 0.001).

**Discussion:**
The findings of this study support the association between extreme body compositions and HCM, as well as the progression of LVH in hypertensive patients. The results are consistent with previous studies indicating that LVH is a common feature of HCM in individuals with obesity or diabetes [2-4]. The elevated NT-proBNP levels in patients with LVH also support the concept that this biomarker may serve as a prognostic indicator for adverse cardiac outcomes.

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the importance of considering extreme body compositions and LVH progression when managing hypertensive patients. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of HCM and to develop effective therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse LVH in this high-risk population.
