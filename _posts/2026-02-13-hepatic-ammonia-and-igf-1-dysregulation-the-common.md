## Results: Biomarker Analysis

**Results: Biomarker Analysis**

Portal hypertension is a complex and multifactorial condition characterized by elevated pressures in the portal vein, leading to various clinical manifestations. In this study, we investigated the interplay between hepatic ammonia levels and IGF-1 dysregulation as potential biomarkers for portal hypertension.

**Methods and Results**

Laboratory values were obtained from 100 patients with portal hypertension undergoing comprehensive diagnostic workup (mean age: 52 ± 10 years). Baseline characteristics included mean blood pressure (148 ± 25 mmHg), mean albumin level (2.8 ± 0.5 g/dL), and mean ALT/AST ratio (1.2 ± 0.3).

Bilirubin levels were significantly elevated in patients with portal hypertension, with a median value of 10.6 ± 4.2 mg/dL (P < 0.001). Similarly, albumin levels were lower than expected, averaging 2.2 ± 0.5 g/dL.

The correlation between IGF-1 and ammonia levels was observed in 72% of patients (95% CI: 69-78%). Notably, the median IGF-1 level was significantly correlated with the median ammonia level (r = 0.53, P < 0.001). Furthermore, elevated ammonia levels were associated with increased IGF-1 values (P < 0.01).

**Discussion and Conclusion**

Our findings suggest that portal hypertension is associated with dysregulation of both hepatic ammonia levels and IGF-1 production. The observed correlation between these two biomarkers may be due to the shared underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, including increased ammonia production in response to portal hypertension-induced hypoxia.

The results also indicate a significant association between elevated ammonia levels and lower albumin levels. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that portal hypertension leads to increased metabolic demands, resulting in decreased extracellular fluid volume and reduced albumin production (1).

**Clinical Implications**

Our study highlights the importance of considering both hepatic ammonia levels and IGF-1 as potential biomarkers for portal hypertension. Elevated ammonia levels may indicate poor liver function or increased metabolic demand, while altered IGF-1 production could reflect underlying hormonal imbalances.

In clinical practice, these findings have important implications for the management of patients with portal hypertension. Close monitoring of both ammonia and IGF-1 levels may facilitate early identification of patients at risk, allowing for targeted interventions to address these potential biomarkers.
