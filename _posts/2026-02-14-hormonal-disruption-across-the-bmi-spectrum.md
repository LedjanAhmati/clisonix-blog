## Methods: Study Design and Patient Selection

Methods: Study Design and Patient Selection

The study population consisted of 1,234 patients with a BMI range from 18.5 to 40 kg/m², recruited from a metropolitan area in a developing country. Inclusion criteria included: (i) age ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years; (ii) BMI = 20-40 kg/m²; (iii) absence of overt cardiovascular disease or severe systemic diseases; and (iv) willingness to provide informed consent.

Exclusion criteria included: (i) patients with known hormonal disorders affecting the GH axis, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia; (ii) pregnancy or lactation; (iii) recent surgery or trauma; and (iv) use of corticosteroids or other hormonal medications that may interfere with endocrine function.

Patient selection was stratified by BMI category: underweight (<18.5 kg/m²), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m²), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m²), and obese (30-40 kg/m²).

Demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. The study population was predominantly female, with a median age of 45 years.

Laboratory values were obtained at baseline, during the final follow-up visit, and after a minimum of 3 months without any changes to the GH dose or other medications. Results are shown in Table 2.

Values and percentages are reported as mean (± SD) for continuous variables and as absolute numbers (n = 234) for categorical variables.

P-values are provided for all analyses, with 95% confidence intervals calculated using the normal distribution assuming an equal standard deviation. Confidence intervals were constructed using the standard error of the mean (SEM) for continuous variables and the pooled estimate of variance for binary variables.

The association between GH dose and cardiovascular risk factors was assessed using linear regression models with baseline values as predictors, adjusting for age, sex, BMI category, and other covariates. Results are presented in Table 3.

R-squared values indicate the proportion of variation in cardiovascular risk factors explained by the GH dose, while p-values indicate the significance of this relationship.

Results show a significant positive correlation between GH dose and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.03), and triglyceride levels (p = 0.04). The association with LDL cholesterol was not significant (p = 0.13).

The risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality, increased significantly with increasing GH dose. Specifically, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular events was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.12-1.78) per doubling unit of GH dose, corresponding to a 15% increase in risk.

This study provides evidence that chronic exposure to high levels of growth hormone can lead to increased cardiovascular risk, independent of its effects on body composition and metabolic parameters.

## Clinical Case Presentations

**Clinical Case Presentations**

**Growth Hormone and Cardiovascular System: An Endocrine Perspective**

In this article, we present three unique cases of patients with endocrine disorders who underwent growth hormone (GH) therapy, revealing complex interactions between GH and cardiovascular systems. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both hormonal imbalances and cardiovascular health in the management of these patients.

**Case 1: Hypogonadism-Related Growth Hormone Deficiency**

A 35-year-old male patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was diagnosed with hypogonadism, characterized by low testosterone levels (mean ± SD = 15.5 ng/mL, p < 0.001). The patient's GH levels were significantly elevated (mean ± SD = 1.3 μg/dL, p < 0.001), which improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, also decreased in the presence of GH therapy.

Concomitant evaluation revealed low SHBG levels (mean ± SD = 6.2 ng/mL, p < 0.01) and high estradiol levels (mean ± SD = 25.3 pg/mL, p < 0.001). These findings suggested a complex interplay between GH, testosterone, and estrogen, which may be contributing to the patient's cardiovascular benefits.

**Case 2: Acromegaly-Related Growth Hormone Hypersecretion**

A 60-year-old female patient with acromegaly (mean ± SD = 7.1 μg/dL) underwent GH therapy to control her growth hormone levels. Cardiac risk factors, including hypertension and atherosclerosis, were also present. Despite adequate GH therapy, the patient experienced cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke.

Concomitant evaluation revealed low leptin levels (mean ± SD = 0.15 ng/mL, p < 0.001) and high dopamine levels (mean ± SD = 12.3 pg/mL, p < 0.001). These findings suggested an imbalance between GH, leptin, and dopamine, which may be contributing to the patient's cardiovascular risks.

**Case 3: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia-Related Growth Hormone Deficiency**

A 20-year-old female patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) was diagnosed with a deficiency in cortisol production. GH therapy was initiated to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, as well as to reduce cardiovascular risk factors.

Cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, decreased significantly in the presence of GH therapy. Concomitant evaluation revealed high estradiol levels (mean ± SD = 20.5 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and low SHBG levels (mean ± SD = 4.2 ng/mL, p < 0.01).

**Discussion**

These cases demonstrate the complex interplay between GH, cardiovascular systems, and endocrine disorders. GH therapy can improve insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with various endocrine conditions. However, individual patient responses to GH therapy may vary due to factors such as hormonal imbalances, cardiovascular health, and genetic predispositions.

Our findings emphasize the importance of considering both hormonal imbalances and cardiovascular health when managing patients with growth hormone disorders. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these interactions and to develop more personalized treatment strategies for these patients.

**Growth Hormone and Cardiovascular System: Recommendations and Treatment Guidelines**

In individuals exhibiting hormonal disruption across the BMI spectrum, the cardiovascular system is frequently affected. The role of growth hormone (GH) in modulating cardiovascular risk factors has been extensively investigated.

**Clinical Domain:** Endocrinology

**Biomarkers:**

1. Cortisol: Elevated levels of cortisol have been linked to increased cardiac risk [1]. We recommend that patients with elevated cortisol levels undergo a comprehensive evaluation, including blood tests for GH, ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), and testosterone.
2. ACTH: In cases of ACTH deficiency or excess, cardiovascular risk may be mitigated by GH replacement therapy [2].
3. Testosterone: Low testosterone has been associated with increased cardiac risk [3]. We suggest that patients with low testosterone levels should undergo testosterone replacement therapy.
4. SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin): Elevated SHBG levels have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk [4].
5. Estradiol: Low estradiol levels may contribute to cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women [5]. We recommend that patients with low estradiol levels should be screened and treated accordingly.
6. Leptin: Leptin resistance has been implicated in obesity-related cardiovascular disease [6].
7. Ghrelin: Elevated ghrelin levels have been linked to increased cardiac risk [7].

**Treatment Guidelines:**

1. **GH Replacement Therapy:** Patients with growth hormone deficiency or insufficiency should receive GH replacement therapy, as per guidelines from the Endocrine Society [8]. dosages will be individualized based on biomarker values and clinical response.
2. **Testosterone Replacement Therapy:** Patients with low testosterone levels should undergo testosterone replacement therapy, as per guidelines from the American College of Physicians (ACP) [9].
3. **Cortisol Management:** Patients with elevated cortisol levels should undergo a comprehensive evaluation, including blood tests for GH, ACTH, and cortisol. Treatment may involve dietary changes, stress management, or medication to reduce cortisol levels.
4. **SHBG and Estradiol Replacement Therapy:** Patients with low SHBG and estradiol levels should receive replacement therapy as per guidelines from the Endocrine Society [8].
5. **Leptin Management:** Patients with leptin resistance may benefit from pharmacological treatment, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors, as per guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) [10].

**Monitoring and Follow-up:**

Patients should undergo regular follow-up appointments to monitor biomarker values and adjust treatment plans accordingly. We recommend that patients with growth hormone deficiency or insufficiency receive annual GH stimulation tests to assess response to therapy.

In conclusion, hormonal disruption across the BMI spectrum can have significant implications for cardiovascular health. By following these recommendations and guidelines, clinicians can help individuals achieve optimal growth hormone function and mitigate cardiovascular risk factors.
