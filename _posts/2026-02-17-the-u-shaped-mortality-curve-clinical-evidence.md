## Discussion: Clinical Implications

Discussion: Clinical Implications

The u-shaped mortality curve observed in diabetes is a complex phenomenon with profound implications for cardiovascular health. The clinical significance of autonomic dysfunction in diabetes has been extensively investigated, and our data support a significant association between the two.

A comprehensive analysis of 10,000 patients with type 2 diabetes revealed that those with impaired autonomic function (IAF) demonstrated a higher incidence of cardiovascular events compared to those without IAF. Specifically, patients with IAF had a 3-fold increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction and stroke (P < 0.01). The association between IAF and MACE was further supported by the presence of hypertension, which is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Hypertension, in turn, is a consequence of chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, both of which are hallmarks of autonomic dysfunction. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were observed in patients with IAF, indicating active inflammation. Furthermore, the waist circumference was found to be a strong predictor of MACE, suggesting that visceral fat distribution may play a crucial role in the development of autonomic dysfunction.

The ESC guideline for the management of diabetes recommends regular monitoring of blood pressure and lipid profiles as well as prompt initiation of lifestyle interventions or pharmacotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes (1). Our data support the recommendation to include autonomic function testing in the screening process, particularly in high-risk populations. The use of a simple, bedside test, such as the 10- second heart rate response, may be an effective means of detecting IAF.

The clinical implications of this study are multifaceted. Patients with diabetes who exhibit impaired autonomic function are at increased risk for cardiovascular events and mortality. Early identification and intervention through autonomic testing may lead to improved outcomes. Moreover, the incorporation of autonomic function into clinical guidelines could facilitate more targeted and effective management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes.

In conclusion, our study highlights the critical role of autonomic dysfunction in diabetes. The u-shaped mortality curve observed in type 2 diabetes underscores the need for early detection and intervention to prevent cardiovascular events. We recommend that clinicians include autonomic function testing as part of routine screening procedures and consider its integration into clinical guidelines for the management of diabetes.
