## Methods: Study Design and Patient Selection

Methods: Study Design and Patient Selection

Objective:
To compare cardiac remodeling in individuals with extreme body composition (EBM) compared to normotopic patients using echocardiography and cardiac MRI.

Study Design:
This prospective, observational study employed a cross-sectional design. A total of 100 patients with EBM (BMI ≥30) and 50 normotopic controls were recruited from the community-based cohort study "Evaluating Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Obesity" (ECSOR). Exclusion criteria included: diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or cardiovascular disease.

Patient Selection:
Patients were selected based on their demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and body composition indices. The EBM group consisted of 40 males and 60 females aged 30-55 years, while the normotopic control group was comprised of 20 males and 30 females with a BMI within the normal range (18.5-24.9 kg/m2). Body mass index (BMI) categories were defined using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.

Study Population:
EBM patients had an average body surface area (BSA) of 1,500 m², with ranges from 800 to 2,000 m². Normotopic controls had a BSA of 1,200-1,600 m² and were representative of the general population.

Echocardiography:
All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) using a 2-dimensional (2D) Doppler echocardiogram with two-dimensional strain imaging (2D strain). Parameters included: left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and cardiac chamber dilation indices.

Cardiac MRI:
Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 1.5 Tesla scanner with mid-cavity inversion recovery gradient echo (MIRGE) sequence. Parameters included: left ventricular volume index, left ventricular mass index, left atrial volume index, and left atrial mass index.

Laboratory Values:
A complete blood count (CBC), lipid profile, glucose tolerance test results, and electrolyte panel were obtained from all patients.

Measurements and Calculations:

* LVEDV: 85.2 ± 12.5 mL/m² (EBM) vs. 60.1 ± 10.8 mL/m² (normotopic) (p < 0.001)
* LVEF: -18.3 ± 4.9% vs. -13.6 ± 3.2% (p < 0.001)
* Cardiac chamber dilation indices:
	+ Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDV): 34.1 ± 5.8 mL/m² (EBM) vs. 24.4 ± 4.9 mL/m² (normotopic) (p < 0.001)
	+ Left ventricular mass index: 15.6 ± 2.3 g/m²^2 (EBM) vs. 10.8 ± 1.5 g/m²^2 (normotopic) (p < 0.05)

Statistical Analysis:
The primary outcome was left ventricular remodeling, as measured by LVEDV and LVEF changes. Secondary outcomes included cardiac chamber dilation indices and lipid profiles.

Results:

EBM patients had significantly greater left ventricular remodeling compared to normotopic controls. Specifically, EBM patients experienced an increase in LVEDV of 23.1 ± 7.5 mL/m² (p < 0.001) and a decrease in LVEF by 4.2 ± 3.8% (-18.3 ± 4.9%) (p < 0.001). These changes were associated with increased left ventricular mass index, cardiac chamber dilation indices, and lipid profiles.

Conclusion:
This study demonstrates that individuals with extreme body composition exhibit significant cardiac remodeling compared to normotopic controls. The findings suggest that EBM may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and highlight the need for tailored prevention strategies in this population.

Limitations:

* This study was observational and did not control for confounding factors.
* Cardiac MRI data were limited to patients with normal coronary artery calcification.
* No additional biomarkers or imaging modalities were used to supplement echocardiography findings.

Cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition: a comparative study

Introduction:
Extreme body composition, characterized by low body mass index (BMI) and high percentage of body fat, is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac imaging has emerged as a crucial tool for assessing cardiac structure and function in these individuals. However, the utility of echocardiography versus cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating cardiac remodeling remains unclear.

Methods:
We conducted a comparative study involving 100 patients with extreme body composition, divided into two groups: one with normal body mass index (BMI ≥ 25) and one with severe obesity (BMI < 20). Patients underwent echocardiography (n=50) and cardiac MRI (n=50).

Results:

* Echocardiography revealed significant left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), characterized by increased left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) and decreased ejection fraction (EF), with mean values of 22.5±4.1 mm and 25.6±3.8%, respectively.
* Cardiac MRI demonstrated substantial myocardial fibrosis, as evidenced by increased myocardial T2-values and reduced end-systolic strain (ESS).
* Blood biomarker analysis revealed elevated levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and troponin I/T in both groups.
* CK-MB was significantly increased in patients with severe obesity, while HDL cholesterol was decreased.

Comparison of biomarker values:
To assess the prognostic utility of echocardiography versus cardiac MRI, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for each biomarker. The AUC values showed significant differences between groups: BNP (95.6%, p < 0.001), NT-proBNP (92.1%, p < 0.01), and Troponin I/T (84.5%, p = 0.03). CK-MB was not significantly different between groups.

Discussion:
Our findings suggest that echocardiography is superior to cardiac MRI in evaluating cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition. The increased LVWT and ESS observed on echocardiography are consistent with the expected hypertrophic response of the left ventricle in response to decreased cardiac workload. Cardiac MRI, while providing valuable information on myocardial fibrosis, did not reveal significant differences between groups.

Clinical implications:
Our study highlights the importance of considering body composition as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Patients with extreme body composition should be evaluated using echocardiography rather than cardiac MRI. This approach may lead to earlier detection and management of cardiac remodeling, ultimately reducing the risk of CVD events.

Limitations:
This study had limitations, including small sample sizes and potential biases in data collection. Future studies are needed to validate these findings and explore the utility of biomarker analysis beyond echocardiography and cardiac MRI.

**Cardiac Remodeling in Extreme Body Composition: A Comparative Study**

**Abstract**

Extreme body composition is increasingly recognized as a significant predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Cardiac remodeling, characterized by changes in cardiac structure and function, contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases. This comparative study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in patients with extreme body composition.

**Introduction**

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Extreme body composition, as defined by high percentage of body fat or muscle mass, has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (1). The ESC, AHA, ACC, EASL, and Endocrine Society guidelines emphasize the importance of identifying and managing cardiovascular risk factors in patients with extreme body composition (2).

**Methods**

We conducted a prospective study involving 100 patients with extreme body composition (defined as BMI ≥ 40) who underwent echocardiography and CMR imaging. Patients were categorized into four groups based on body fat percentage: group A (BMI <10%, n = 25), group B (BMI 10-19%, n = 30), group C (BMI 20-29%, n = 35), and group D (BMI ≥ 30, n = 40). Clinical characteristics, including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal function, were recorded.

**Echocardiography and CMR Imaging**

Echocardiography was performed using conventional M-mode echocardiography to assess left ventricular wall thickness, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and right ventricular ejection fraction (RV EF). CMR imaging was performed with a 2.0 Tesla scanner to evaluate cardiac structure and function.

**Predictive Biomarkers**

BNP, NT-proBNP, Troponin I/T, CK-MB, LDL, HDL, triglycerides were measured in all patients. Correlation coefficients (r) and p-values were calculated for each biomarker with the echocardiographic parameters.

**Results**

Table 1 summarizes the clinical characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and CMR imaging results of the four groups.

| Group | BMI (kg/m^2) | Age (years) | Sex | Hypertension | Diabetes Mellitus | Renal Function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 10.3 ± 4.5 | 58 ± 8 | M | Yes | No | Normal |
| B | 14.1 ± 6.2 | 67 ± 9 | F | Yes | Yes | Mild |
| C | 24.1 ± 13.6 | 81 ± 11 | M | Yes | Yes | Severe |
| D | 33.3 ± 17.4 | 91 ± 12 | F | Yes | No | Significant |

**Discussion**

Our study demonstrates that echocardiography and CMR imaging are effective in predicting cardiac remodeling in patients with extreme body composition. The correlation between echocardiographic parameters and biomarkers was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The results suggest that elevated BNP, NT-proBNP, Troponin I/T, CK-MB, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides may serve as surrogate markers for cardiac remodeling in this population.

**Conclusion**

The findings of this comparative study highlight the importance of echocardiography and CMR imaging in identifying patients with extreme body composition at risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These biomarkers can be used to predict cardiac remodeling and guide clinical management strategies, particularly in the context of lifestyle modification and pharmacological therapy.

## Discussion: Clinical Implications

**Discussion: Clinical Implications**

Cardiac remodeling, characterized by alterations in ventricular structure and function, is a hallmark of chronic cardiomyopathy. Extreme body composition, including obesity, sarcopenia, and renal impairment, contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction. In this study, we compared the prognostic value of echocardiography-guided cardiac MRI versus cardiac biomarker analysis in patients with extreme body composition.

**Methods**

We conducted a comparative study involving 100 patients with end-stage chronic heart failure (ECHO-HF) and 50 patients with obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients underwent echocardiography-guided cardiac MRI, cardiac biomarker analysis using troponin I/T and CK-MB, and serum lipid profiles. We also measured body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and muscle mass.

**Results**

Echocardiography-guided cardiac MRI revealed significant left ventricular hypertrophy and decreased global wall thickness in patients with ECHO-HF, whereas cardiac biomarker analysis identified elevated troponin I/T and CK-MB levels. Serum lipid profiles showed marked increases in LDL cholesterol and decreases in HDL cholesterol.

**Discussion**

Our findings suggest that echocardiography-guided cardiac MRI provides valuable prognostic information beyond traditional cardiac biomarkers. The high sensitivity of echocardiography for detecting left ventricular hypertrophy and global wall thickening in patients with extreme body composition is consistent with the observed increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

The elevated troponin I/T levels detected by echocardiography-guided cardiac MRI are also consistent with the significant reduction in muscle mass and strength observed in patients with ECHO-HF. These results support the notion that echocardiography-guided cardiac MRI is a useful tool for predicting cardiovascular outcomes in patients with extreme body composition.

**Clinical Implications**

Our study highlights the importance of considering extreme body composition as a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with ECHO-HF and CKD. The results of this study have implications for the management of these patient populations, including the use of echocardiography-guided cardiac MRI and cardiac biomarker analysis as adjunctive diagnostic tools.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that echocardiography-guided cardiac MRI provides valuable prognostic information beyond traditional cardiac biomarkers in patients with extreme body composition. The results of this study have important implications for the management of these patient populations, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach to risk stratification and prevention.

This study compared the effects of extreme body composition on cardiac function and structure using echocardiography and cardiac MRI. The results showed significant differences in left ventricular mass, chamber sizes, and wall thickness between normal-weight and obese individuals, as well as those with severe obesity and metabolic syndrome.

A multivariate analysis revealed that BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) levels were significantly higher in obese patients compared to the normal-weight group (p < 0.001), while NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide) was also elevated in obese individuals (p < 0.01). Troponin I/T and CK-MB (creatine kinase-myocardial band) levels were not significantly different between groups.

LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and triglycerides were also found to be higher in obese patients, with p-values of < 0.05 (p < 0.01 for LDL; p = 0.08 for triglycerides). Conversely, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol was lower in obese individuals, although the difference was not statistically significant.

The cardiac MRI findings supported these echocardiographic results, showing increased left ventricular mass and decreased chamber sizes in obese patients compared to the normal-weight group (p < 0.001).
