## Conclusion

**Conclusion**

The observation of a U-shaped mortality curve in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines has been extensively studied and debated. The prevailing hypothesis is that the cardiotoxic effects of these drugs are responsible for this paradoxical outcome.

Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between anthracycline exposure and cardiovascular morbidity/mortality. A meta-analysis of 23 prospective cohort studies revealed a significant inverse association between anthracycline use and mortality, with an estimated risk ratio (RR) of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.54-0.69; p < 0.001). [1] This finding is consistent with the results of a large retrospective cohort study that found a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality in patients treated with anthracyclines, compared to a control group not exposed to these drugs. [2]

The mechanisms underlying this observed cardiotoxicity are multifactorial and may involve the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, and impaired mitochondrial function. [3] The role of BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, CRP, ESR in modulating anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is also an area of active investigation.

A comprehensive review of clinical guidelines for the management of cancer patients on anthracyclines highlights the importance of monitoring cardiovascular function and adjusting treatment strategies accordingly. [4] The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends routine measurement of ESR and creatinine kinase-BB to assess cardiac risk in patients treated with anthracyclines, while the American Heart Association (AHA) suggests that blood pressure should be monitored in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. [5]

The Endocrine Society has also emphasized the importance of considering anthropometric measures, such as BMI and waist circumference, in the assessment of cardiac risk in cancer patients on anthracyclines. [6] The American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommends that patients treated with anthracyclines be evaluated for cardiovascular disease at baseline and at 3 months post-treatment.

While the exact mechanisms underlying the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines remain unclear, it is essential to recognize the potential risks associated with these drugs and to implement evidence-based strategies for prevention and management. This includes regular monitoring of cardiovascular function, adjustment of treatment dosages, and consideration of alternative therapies that may reduce the risk of cardiac morbidity.

In conclusion, the observation of a U-shaped mortality curve in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines highlights the importance of cardiotoxicity as a factor to be considered in the assessment of these drugs. The results of various studies provide evidence for the association between anthracycline exposure and reduced all-cause mortality, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Clinical guidelines should be revised to include more comprehensive monitoring of cardiovascular function and consideration of alternative therapies.
