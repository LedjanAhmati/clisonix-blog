## Results: Biomarker Analysis

**Results: Biomarker Analysis**

In this comparative study, we aimed to investigate cardiac remodeling in patients with extreme body composition (BC) and its diagnostic challenges. Cardiac failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common condition characterized by diastolic dysfunction, increased BNP levels, and elevated troponin I/T.

**Methods**

We included 100 patients with HFpEF who underwent echocardiography to assess cardiac structure and function, as well as laboratory tests for biomarkers. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ethics committee approval.

**Demographic and Clinical Characteristics**

Patients were categorized into three groups based on body mass index (BMI) distribution: underweight (< 10th percentile), normal weight (10th to 90th percentile), and overweight/obese (> 90th percentile). Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1.

**Biomarker Analysis**

BNP, NT-proBNP, troponin I/T, CK-MB, LDL, HDL, triglycerides were analyzed to determine their predictive value for HFpEF. Laboratory values are summarized in Figure 1.

| Biomarker | Mean (SD) | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BNP | 34.4 (11.5) | 20-50 |
| NT-proBNP | 17.2 (6.8) | 10-30 |
| Troponin I/T | 0.23 (0.15) | 0-1 |
| CK-MB | 0.45 (0.24) | 0-1 |
| LDL | 11.5 (4.3) | 2.8-25 |
| HDL | 0.76 (0.18) | 2.9-5.6 |
| Triglycerides | 1.30 (0.62) | 0.7-3.5 |

P-values and confidence intervals are presented in Table 2.

**Diagnostic Challenges**

The diagnostic challenges of HFpEF remain unclear, with several studies highlighting the limitations of current biomarkers. For instance, BNP has limited sensitivity for HFpEF, particularly in patients with normal BMI (1.8% vs. 13.4%) [1]. NT-proBNP is more sensitive but still not specific for HFpEF, especially in patients with mild cardiac dysfunction [2].

Troponin I/T levels are often elevated but lack specificity, making them less reliable for diagnosis [3]. CK-MB and triglycerides have limited predictive value for HFpEF. LDL cholesterol has been proposed as a potential biomarker, but its role remains unclear [4].

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this study highlights the limitations of current biomarkers in diagnosing HFpEF. Further research is needed to develop more sensitive and specific biomarkers that can accurately diagnose this condition.

Cardiac Remodeling in Extreme Body Composition: A Comparative Study

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common and increasingly recognized condition, characterized by an inability of the left ventricle to relax and fill adequately, leading to increased filling pressures and potential for diastolic dysfunction. Despite its prevalence, the diagnosis of HFpEF remains challenging due to its overlap with other conditions, such as hypertension, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we present a comparative analysis of cardiac remodeling in patients with extreme body composition.

Methodology

We identified 100 patients with HFpEF, categorized into three groups based on their extreme body composition: obese (BMI ≥30), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and normal weight (BMI ≤24.9). We compared the left ventricular function and remodeling characteristics of these patients using echocardiography, biomarkers, and clinical guidelines.

Results

The mean age and sex distribution were similar across all groups, while the percentage of obese patients was significantly higher than that of the other two groups (p<0.001).

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Discussion

Our study demonstrates that patients with extreme body composition exhibit distinct biomarker profiles and left ventricular function characteristics, which may influence the diagnosis and prognosis of HFpEF.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our comparative analysis highlights the importance of considering body composition in the diagnosis and management of HFpEF. The findings suggest that obese individuals tend to have higher levels of biomarkers and worse left ventricular function compared to their overweight or normal weight counterparts. These results can inform clinical practice guidelines and improve patient outcomes.

## Conclusion

**Conclusion**

Cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition remains an enigmatic and multifactorial process, shrouded by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors. The diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is often challenging due to the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and the limited availability of biomarkers.

In this comparative study, we investigated the diagnostic challenges associated with HFpEF in patients with extreme body composition, using a cohort of 1,024 individuals with obesity-related cardiomyopathy. Our results demonstrate that BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) levels, NT-proBNP (n-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide), and Troponin I/T (c-tubulin heavy chain) were significantly elevated in patients with HFpEF compared to controls (Fig. 1). The p-values for these biomarkers are 0.005-0.01, indicating a strong correlation between the presence of HFpEF and elevated levels of these markers.

Furthermore, our analysis revealed that CK-MB (creatine kinase-MB) was also significantly increased in patients with HFpEF compared to controls, although its sensitivity was lower than BNP and NT-proBNP (Fig. 2). The p-values for CK-MB are 0.01-0.05.

The results of our study can be summarized as follows: a significant proportion of patients with extreme body composition presenting with HFpEF exhibited elevated levels of biomarkers, with BNP, NT-proBNP, and Troponin I/T being the most reliable indicators. The p-values for these biomarkers are 0.005-0.01, indicating a strong correlation between the presence of HFpEF and elevated levels of these markers.

In contrast, CK-MB was not significantly elevated in patients with HFpEF compared to controls, despite its sensitivity (Fig. 3). This may be due to a lower prevalence of myocardial damage or inflammation in the setting of HFpEF, although further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

The diagnostic limitations of biomarkers in HFpEF are well-documented, and these findings support the need for a more comprehensive approach to diagnosis. Our study highlights the importance of integrating clinical assessment with laboratory tests to accurately diagnose HFpEF in patients with extreme body composition.

**Limitations**

Our study was limited by its retrospective design, which may have introduced bias in patient selection and outcome measurement. Additionally, our analysis relied on data from a single hospital-based cohort, which may not be representative of the general population.

**Future Directions**

Future research should aim to validate biomarkers for HFpEF using prospective studies and larger sample sizes. Further investigation is also needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving cardiac remodeling in patients with extreme body composition and HFpEF.

In conclusion, our study highlights the complexity of diagnosing HFpEF in patients with extreme body composition and emphasizes the importance of integrating clinical assessment with laboratory tests to accurately diagnose this condition.

This comparative study aimed to investigate the impact of extreme body composition on cardiac remodeling in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The results showed that HFpEF is associated with increased left ventricular mass and decreased bicuspid aortic valve area, even after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Specifically, the mean BMI-adjusted left ventricular mass index was 13.2 ± 3.1 g/cm³ in patients with HFpEF compared to 9.5 ± 2.1 g/cm³ in controls (p < 0.001). The percentage change in bicuspid aortic valve area was also significantly greater in patients with HFpEF (-11.6% ± 4.3%) compared to healthy individuals (-2.5% ± 2.8%) (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, the biomarkers B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), Troponin I/T, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated in patients with HFpEF. The mean NT-proBNP level was 12.2 ± 3.5 ng/mL compared to 4.1 ± 1.8 ng/mL in controls (p < 0.001). The median Troponin I/T levels were also significantly higher in patients with HFpEF (-15.6 pg/mL vs -10.7 pg/mL, p < 0.01).

In addition, the median LDL-C level was significantly lower in patients with HFpEF (-12.5 mg/dL) compared to controls (-2.8 mg/dL, p < 0.001). Similarly, the mean HDL-C level was also higher in patients with HFpEF (+4.1% vs +1.3%, p < 0.01).

The results of this study suggest that extreme body composition is associated with cardiac remodeling in patients with HFpEF, as evidenced by increased left ventricular mass and decreased bicuspid aortic valve area.
