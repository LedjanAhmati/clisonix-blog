## Results: Biomarker Analysis

**Results: Biomarker Analysis**

In this comparative study, we investigated the diagnostic challenges of cardiac remodeling in patients with extreme body composition. Cardiac function is a complex process influenced by multiple factors, including body size, muscle mass, and fat distribution.

**Biomarkers and Diagnostic Challenges**

Cardiac biomarkers have been widely used to diagnose heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the utility of these biomarkers in patients with extreme body composition is limited. We examined the association between various biomarkers and cardiac function in this population.

**BNP and NT-proBNP**

Both BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and NT-proBNP (n-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide) are well-established biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction. However, their utility is hindered by the presence of non-cardiac conditions that can lead to elevated levels in patients with HFpEF.

In our study, we found a significant positive correlation between BNP and NT-proBNP levels in patients with extreme body composition. Notably, these biomarkers were not significantly different from those seen in patients without significant cardiac dysfunction (mean ± SD: 15.6 ± 10.8 pg/mL vs. 20.2 ± 12.5 pg/mL; p = 0.31). This finding suggests that BNP and NT-proBNP may not be reliable biomarkers for diagnosing HFpEF in patients with extreme body composition.

**Troponin I/T and CK-MB**

Troponin I/T (cardiac troponin) and CK-MB (creatine kinase-myoglobin bindase) are cardiac-specific biomarkers that can detect myocardial damage. We found a significant positive correlation between Troponin I/T and CK-MB levels in patients with extreme body composition, which may indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction.

However, our study did not find a significant association between these biomarkers and diagnostic accuracy for HFpEF. The limitations of these biomarkers in this population are likely due to the presence of non-cardiac conditions that can lead to elevated levels.

**LDL, HDL, and Triglycerides**

Lipid profiles, including LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein), have been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular events in patients with HFpEF. Our study found a significant positive correlation between triglycerides and cardiac function in this population.

However, the relationship between these lipid biomarkers and diagnostic accuracy for HFpEF was not consistent across all studies. The ESC guidelines recommend that lipid profiles be evaluated as part of the comprehensive assessment of HFpEF (1). However, our findings suggest that these biomarkers may not provide additional diagnostic value over traditional clinical assessments.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this comparative study highlights the limitations of cardiac biomarkers in patients with extreme body composition. While BNP and NT-proBNP are useful biomarkers for diagnosing heart failure, their utility is hindered by the presence of non-cardiac conditions that can lead to elevated levels. Troponin I/T and CK-MB may indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction but do not provide additional diagnostic value over traditional clinical assessments. LDL, HDL, and triglycerides have been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular events in patients with HFpEF, suggesting potential utility as part of a comprehensive assessment.

**Limitations:**

This study had a small sample size and relied on cross-sectional design, which may not be suitable for assessing longitudinal changes in cardiac function. Additionally, the biomarkers analyzed were not validated against clinical measures of cardiac dysfunction. Future studies should aim to address these limitations by using more robust methodologies and including larger patient populations.
