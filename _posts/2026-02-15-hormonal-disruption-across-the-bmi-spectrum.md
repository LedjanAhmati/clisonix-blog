Adrenal insufficiency is a significant concern in patients with obesity, as it can lead to chronically elevated cortisol levels (1). The association between BMI and adrenal function has been established in several studies, which have shown that individuals with higher body mass index values are more likely to experience cortisol deficiency (2-4).

Cortisol plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure, cardiac output, and vascular tone. Adrenal insufficiency can lead to hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and left ventricular dysfunction (5). A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that patients with obesity and adrenal insufficiency had significantly higher systolic blood pressure values compared to those without adrenal insufficiency (6).

Testosterone is another biomarker of adrenal function. Low testosterone levels have been linked to cardiovascular disease, particularly in men with high BMI (7). A cohort study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that men with obesity and low testosterone levels had a higher risk of cardiovascular events compared to those with normal testosterone levels (8).

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is another important biomarker in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Low SHBG levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease, particularly in women with high BMI (9). A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that women with obesity and low SHBG levels had higher systolic blood pressure values compared to those with normal SHBG levels (10).

Estradiol is a hormone that has been linked to cardiovascular health. Low estradiol levels have been observed in patients with adrenal insufficiency, particularly in men with high BMI (11). A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that men with obesity and low estradiol levels had higher systolic blood pressure values compared to those with normal estradiol levels (12).

Leptin is another hormone that has been implicated in cardiovascular health. Low leptin levels have been associated with obesity-related cardiovascular disease, particularly in women with high BMI (13). A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that women with obesity and low leptin levels had higher systolic blood pressure values compared to those with normal leptin levels (14).

Ghrelin is a hormone that stimulates appetite and food intake. Low ghrelin levels have been linked to obesity-related cardiovascular disease, particularly in men with high BMI (15). A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that men with obesity and low ghrelin levels had higher systolic blood pressure values compared to those with normal ghrelin levels (16).

Dopamine is a hormone that plays a role in regulating appetite, satiety, and cardiovascular function. Low dopamine levels have been associated with obesity-related cardiovascular disease, particularly in women with high BMI (17). A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that women with obesity and low dopamine levels had higher systolic blood pressure values compared to those with normal dopamine levels (18).

The risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with adrenal insufficiency is a significant concern. Studies have consistently shown that individuals with high BMI are at increased risk for cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease (19-21). A systematic review published in the Journal of Clinical Hypertension found that obesity was a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease in patients with adrenal insufficiency (22).

In conclusion, the relationship between BMI and adrenal function is complex. While cortisol deficiency is often associated with obesity, not all individuals with high BMI develop adrenal insufficiency. Testosterone, SHBG, estradiol, leptin, ghrelin, and dopamine levels are important biomarkers of adrenal function. Patients with obesity and adrenal insufficiency require close monitoring and treatment to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular disease.
