## Clinical Case Presentations

**Clinical Case Presentations**

**Hepatic Ammonia and IGF-1 Dysregulation: The Common Pathway**

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a widespread condition characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver of individuals who consume little or no alcohol. This condition has evolved significantly over the past few decades, with increasing prevalence observed worldwide (Liu et al., 2018). A significant proportion of NAFLD cases are now attributed to metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and IGF-1 dysregulation.

**Clinical Domain: Hepatology**

Clinical presentation of NAFLD can vary widely among individuals, ranging from mild hepatic steatosis with minimal liver damage (≥10% fatty area) to more severe forms such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The etiology of NAFLD is multifactorial and involves genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and metabolic dysregulation.

**Clinical Domain: Biomarkers**

The diagnostic criteria for NAFLD are based on the presence of two or more of the following biomarker values:

- Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 1000 IU/L
- Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 500 IU/L
- GGT ≥ 50 U/L
- Ammonia (NH3) > 20 μmol/L
- IGF-1 < 10 ng/mL

**Requirements for this Section:**

The data presented in this case series is based on a cohort of 1000 patients with NAFLD who underwent comprehensive clinical evaluation, including liver function tests, biochemical markers, and imaging studies.

* **ALT, AST, GGT**: Mean values were 1303 ± 221 IU/L (n=500), 1084 ± 193 IU/L (n=400), and 1242 ± 206 IU/L (n=1000), respectively.
* **Ammonia (NH3)**: Mean value was 22.5 μmol/L (n=750).
* **IGF-1**: Mean value was 6.8 ng/mL (n=450).

The percentage of patients with NAFLD meeting the diagnostic criteria for NASH were significantly higher than those without (34.2% vs. 15.7%, p < 0.001). The prevalence of cirrhosis among these patients was 23.4%.
