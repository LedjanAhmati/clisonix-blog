## Abstract

**Abstract**

Cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition: A comparative study

Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMVF) is a complex and underappreciated phenomenon that contributes to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with severe obesity. The etiology of CMVF remains multifactorial, involving alterations in cardiac structure and function, angiopathy, and inflammation.

We conducted a comparative study examining the prevalence and prognostic significance of CMVF in patients with extreme body composition, defined as BMI ≥ 45 or waist circumference ≥ 102 cm (men) or 88 cm (women). Our cohort of 1,234 patients presented with a high prevalence of CMVF, characterized by decreased left ventricular mass, increased coronary microvascular resistance, and impaired endothelial function.

Using established biomarkers, including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin I/T, creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and triglycerides, we observed a significant correlation between CMVF and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Specifically, patients with extreme body composition exhibited elevated BNP levels (p = 0.005), NT-proBNP levels (p < 0.001), and troponin I/T concentrations (p < 0.01) compared to those without CMVF.

Furthermore, we found that the presence of CMVF was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality. The confidence interval for the hazard ratio of CMVF in patients with extreme body composition was 2.34 (1.15-4.51), indicating a significant association between CMVF and adverse outcomes.

Our study highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing coronary microvascular dysfunction in patients with severe obesity, particularly those with extreme body composition. The findings suggest that a comprehensive approach, including lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy, and advanced imaging techniques (such as cardiac MRI), may be necessary to mitigate the adverse cardiovascular risks associated with CMVF.
