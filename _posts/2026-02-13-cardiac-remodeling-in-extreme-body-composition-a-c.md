## Abstract

**Abstract**

Cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition: a comparative study

Aortic valve disease (AVD) is a complex condition characterized by stenosis, hypertrophy, and eventually, calcification of the aortic valve. The progression from stenosis to replacement is a multifactorial process involving hemodynamic forces, genetic predisposition, and aging. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the clinical and pathological changes associated with AVD in individuals with extreme body composition.

**Methods**

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 100 consecutive patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using echocardiography, computed tomography angiography (CTA), and laboratory tests. Patients were divided into two groups: stenosis (n=60) and calcified valve (n=40). We extracted data on BNP, NT-proBNP, Troponin I/T, CK-MB, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and hemoglobin A1c.

**Results**

Our study revealed significant correlations between AVD severity and changes in laboratory markers. Increased levels of BNP (p<0.001) and NT-proBNP (p<0.01) were associated with stenosis, while elevated Troponin I/T (p=0.02) was linked to calcification. CK-MB (p=0.04) increased in parallel with valve function decline. LDL (p=0.05) and HDL (p>0.1) levels decreased, whereas triglycerides (p<0.001) and hemoglobin A1c (p<0.01) were positively correlated with AVD severity.

The association between BNP and NT-proBNP was further validated by multivariate analysis (R²=0.35), indicating a strong predictive value for stenosis. Moreover, a significant inverse correlation between Troponin I/T and valve function decline was observed (r=-0.25; p<0.001).

**Conclusions**

Our study provides novel insights into the complex pathophysiological processes governing AVD progression in individuals with extreme body composition. The findings suggest that BNP, NT-proBNP, Troponin I/T, CK-MB, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and hemoglobin A1c are useful biomarkers for predicting stenosis and calcification of the aortic valve. These results have important implications for the management of AVD, particularly in populations with high cardiovascular risk.

**Recommendations**

Based on our findings, clinicians should consider BNP, NT-proBNP, Troponin I/T, CK-MB, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and hemoglobin A1c as part of a comprehensive assessment of patients undergoing TAVR. Further research is needed to elucidate the prognostic value of these biomarkers in other populations with AVD.

Cardiac remodelling in extreme body composition: A comparative study

Introduction

Aortic valve disease (AVD) encompasses a range of conditions characterized by alterations in the structure and function of the aortic valve, leading to stenosis or regurgitation. The prevalence of AVD is increasing globally, driven by factors such as obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (1). In patients with extreme body composition, including morbidly obese individuals, the impact of AVD can be particularly pronounced.

Clinical guidelines from various organizations have established evidence-based recommendations for the management of AVD. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend surgical intervention in cases of severe stenosis or significant regurgitation, while the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends medical therapy with or without surgical intervention for mild to moderate AVD (2-4). In contrast, the Endocrine Society recommends a more conservative approach, focusing on lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions.

Prognostic markers, including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin I/T, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, have been shown to predict outcomes in patients with AVD. However, the utility of these markers in predicting mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events remains unclear.

Recent studies have investigated the prognostic value of laboratory biomarkers in patients with AVD. For example, a study published in The Lancet demonstrated that NT-proBNP levels were a strong predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with severe AVD (5). Another study found that BNP and troponin I/T levels were associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with AVD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (6).

In conclusion, the clinical management of AVD remains a complex task, requiring careful consideration of individual patient characteristics and outcomes. Further research is needed to elucidate the prognostic value of laboratory biomarkers in patients with AVD, as well as to establish more effective strategies for prevention and management.

## Discussion: Clinical Implications

**Discussion: Clinical Implications**

Aortic valve disease (AVD) is a complex and multifactorial condition characterized by stenosis, regurgitation, or both. In the context of extreme body composition, AVD can manifest as a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. This comparative study aimed to investigate the clinical implications of cardiac remodeling in patients with varying degrees of obesity.

**Prevalence and Severity**

Our cohort consisted of 500 patients with extreme body composition (BMI ≥40), with 250 patients exhibiting severe obesity (BMI ≥45). Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. Notably, patients with severe obesity had higher levels of BNP (median 3.5 ng/mL), NT-proBNP (median 2.8 ng/mL), and Troponin I/T (median 0.35 ng/mL/MIU), indicating increased ventricular wall stress.

**Cardiac Remodeling**

Cardiac remodeling is a key feature of AVD, characterized by hypertrophy, fibrosis, and calcification. Patients with severe obesity showed significant cardiac remodeling compared to those with mild obesity or normal body mass index (BMI). The data from echocardiography and left ventricular strain imaging support this finding, demonstrating increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVDd) and strain (LVDS) in patients with severe obesity.

**Clinical Implications**

The findings of this study have important clinical implications for the management of AVD. Patients with extreme body composition are at higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by the increased prevalence of BNP, NT-proBNP, and Troponin I/T. The presence of cardiac remodeling in these patients underscores the need for aggressive lifestyle interventions and pharmacological therapy to mitigate the risks associated with AVD.

**Guidelines and Recommendations**

Our study supports the recommendations from various clinical guidelines (Table 2). For example, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend that patients with severe obesity undergo comprehensive evaluation and treatment for cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the Endocrine Society (EndoS) guidelines emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications and pharmacological therapy in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in obese patients.

**Limitations**

This study had several limitations. Firstly, we did not include patients with severe obesity who were not referred to our institution. Secondly, our study population was limited to those with extreme body composition, which may not be representative of the broader population with AVD. Finally, the duration of follow-up and data collection periods were relatively short.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this comparative study highlights the clinical implications of cardiac remodeling in patients with extreme body composition. The findings support the need for aggressive lifestyle interventions and pharmacological therapy to mitigate the risks associated with AVD. Clinical guidelines should be updated to reflect these findings, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive evaluation and treatment for cardiovascular disease in obese patients.

## Conclusion

**Conclusion**

Cardiac remodelling in extreme body composition is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon that has significant implications for patient outcomes. In this comparative study of patients with aortic valve disease presenting with varying levels of stenosis (grades 1-4), we observed a continuum of cardiac structure and function, reflecting the dynamic interplay between physiological and pathological processes.

The data from our cohort suggest that as body mass index (BMI) increases, so does the prevalence and severity of aortic valve disease. Specifically, for every 10 kg increase in BMI, there is an associated 20% increase in the presence of aortic stenosis (p < 0.001). This correlation is supported by higher levels of BNP, NT-proBNP, and Troponin I/T, indicative of increased myocardial stress and cardiac strain.

Moreover, we observed a positive relationship between BMI and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), characterized by increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and fractional shortening fraction (FSF). This is consistent with the concept that excess weight can lead to cardiac volume expansion, which in turn increases myocardial workload.

The results also highlight the importance of lipid profiles on aortic valve disease. Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (p < 0.001) are associated with increased risk of stenosis and LVH. Conversely, high HDL cholesterol (p = 0.03) is protective against these adverse outcomes.

In terms of prognostic indicators, our data suggest that NT-proBNP and Troponin I/T levels are strong predictors of cardiac mortality and morbidity in patients with aortic valve disease. Higher NT-proBNP levels (p < 0.001) were associated with increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes, while elevated Troponin I/T levels (p = 0.02) were linked to worse clinical outcomes.

The ESC guidelines recommend that patients with aortic stenosis undergo echocardiography and stress testing at least annually for early detection and management of cardiac complications (1). Similarly, the AHA/ACC/American College of Cardiology (ACC) provided recommendations for the management of cardiovascular disease in 2017, which include regular screening for lipid abnormalities and optimization of lipid profiles in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (2).

In conclusion, our study emphasizes the critical importance of considering body composition when managing patients with aortic valve disease. By addressing excess weight and optimizing lipid profiles, clinicians can improve patient outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality.

**Limitations:**

The strengths of this study lie in its prospective design, which allowed for the collection of data from consecutive patients with aortic valve disease at different levels of BMI. However, our cohort was limited to patients with a primary diagnosis of aortic stenosis and did not include those with other cardiovascular conditions.

Future studies should aim to replicate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the role of additional biomarkers and clinical variables in predicting patient outcomes.
