## Results: Biomarker Analysis

**Results: Biomarker Analysis**

In this comparative study, we investigated the progression of aortic valve disease (AVD) from stenosis to replacement in patients with extreme body composition. A total of 100 consecutive patients presenting with AVD were enrolled in the study. The demographic characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1.

**Clinical Domain: Cardiology**

AVD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in individuals with obesity (≥30% excess weight). It manifests as stenosis or regurgitation of the aortic valve, leading to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased risk of heart failure (HF).

**Biomarkers:**

We assessed biomarker levels in patients undergoing echocardiography and cardiac MRI. The results are presented in Table 2.

| Biomarker | Mean ± SD | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BNP | 30.4 ± 19.1 pg/mL | 0-150 pg/mL |
| NT-proBNP | 6.3 ± 5.8 pg/mL | 0-100 pg/mL |
| Troponin I/T | 25.9 ± 12.2 ng/mL | 0-100 ng/mL |
| CK-MB | 1.4 ± 0.7 U/L | 0-3 U/L |
| LDL | 14.5 ± 6.8 mg/dL | 10-30 mg/dL |
| HDL | 33.2 ± 11.9 mg/dL | 20-50 mg/dL |
| Triglycerides | 1.4 ± 0.7 mmol/L | 35-110 mmol/L |

**P-values and Confidence Intervals:**

* BNP: ≥15 pg/mL, p<0.001
* NT-proBNP: ≥3 ng/mL, p<0.05
* Troponin I/T: ≥5 ng/mL, p<0.01
* CK-MB: ≥1 U/L, p=0.001
* LDL: <20 mg/dL, p>0.05
* HDL: >50 mg/dL, p<0.001
* Triglycerides: <100 mmol/L, p>0.05

**Clinical Guidelines:**

Our results are in line with the clinical guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), which recommend regular assessment of biomarkers for early detection of AVD progression (1). However, our study also highlights the importance of incorporating these biomarkers into a comprehensive risk stratification strategy.

**Limitations:**

Our study was limited by its retrospective design and lack of longitudinal follow-up. Future studies should aim to enroll patients in prospective cohorts to assess the predictive validity of biomarker levels for AVD progression.

## Conclusion

CONCLUSION

Cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition is a complex and multifactorial process that underscores the dynamic nature of cardiac structure and function. In this comparative study, we examined the relationship between body fat percentage, cardiovascular risk factors, and aortic valve disease progression.

Using data from 1000 patients with obesity (BMI ≥30), our cohort analysis revealed a significant association between increased body fat percentage and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) as evidenced by elevated BNP and NT-proBNP levels (p<0.001). Furthermore, the presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus was strongly correlated with decreased HDL cholesterol levels (p<0.01) and elevated triglycerides (p<0.05).

The relationship between body fat percentage and aortic valve disease progression was also observed in our cohort analysis, where patients with higher BMI had increased NT-proBNP levels and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared to those with lower BMI (p<0.01). Notably, the presence of dyslipidemia was significantly associated with decreased LVEF (p<0.05).

Our findings are consistent with previous studies that have reported a strong correlation between body fat percentage and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with obesity (1-3). The ESC guidelines recommend that individuals with high BMI (>30) undergo regular cardiovascular assessments, including lipid profiles and blood pressure monitoring (4). Similarly, the AHA/ACC/American College of Cardiology (ACC) statement on Obesity highlights the importance of weight management for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with obesity (5).

In this study, we observed a significant association between increased body fat percentage and the progression of aortic valve disease. The present findings also underscore the importance of considering body composition as a critical factor in assessing cardiovascular risk in clinical practice.

While our study had limitations, including its retrospective design and limited sample size, these findings contribute to a growing body of evidence highlighting the complex interplay between obesity, cardiac structure and function, and cardiovascular risk factors. Future studies should aim to replicate these findings using more robust methodologies and larger datasets to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship.

In conclusion, our comparative study highlights the importance of considering body composition as a critical factor in assessing cardiovascular risk in patients with extreme body fat percentage. The present findings underscore the need for clinicians to consider the impact of obesity on cardiac structure and function when managing cardiovascular disease, and highlight the significance of implementing weight management strategies in individuals with high BMI.

Cardiac Remodeling in Extreme Body Composition: A Comparative Study

Introduction

Aortic valve disease (AVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In patients with extreme body composition, such as obesity or significant sarcopenia, AVD can be more challenging to diagnose and manage (1). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between body composition and aortic valve function in a cohort of patients with severe weight loss.

Methods

We analyzed data from 100 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for isolated coronary artery disease. Patients were categorized into three groups based on their body mass index (BMI): underweight (<20 kg/m2), normal weight (20-35 kg/m2), and obese (≥36 kg/m2). The primary outcome measures were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and aortic valve function as assessed by transesophageal echocardiography.

Results

Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. Patients with severe weight loss (<20% BMI change) had higher LVEF values compared to those with normal or obese BMI changes. A significant association between LVEF and BMI was observed (r = -0.55, p < 0.001). In contrast, aortic valve function was not significantly altered in patients with severe weight loss.

A comprehensive analysis of biomarkers revealed that the percentage of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was positively correlated with LVEF values and aortic valve dysfunction. The median values for LDL-C were 2.5 mg/dL, 3.4 mg/dL, and 4.1 mg/dL in underweight, normal weight, and obese patients, respectively.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that the severity of body composition is a critical determinant of aortic valve function in patients with severe weight loss. The observed relationship between LDL-C levels and LVEF values supports the notion that cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, play a significant role in the progression of AVD.

Discussion

The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering body composition as a potential contributor to aortic valve dysfunction in patients with severe weight loss. The observed association between LDL-C levels and LVEF values underscores the need for comprehensive lipid management strategies in these patients.

Conclusion

Cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition is complex and multifactorial, involving various biomarkers and clinical factors. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and to develop effective therapeutic strategies to address cardiovascular risk in these high-risk populations.
