The prevailing hypothesis is that the cardiotoxic effects of these drugs are responsible for this paradoxical outcome.</p><p>Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between anthracycline exposure and cardiovascular morbidity/mortality. A meta-analysis of 23 prospective cohort studies revealed a significant inverse association between anthracycline use and mortality, with an estimated risk ratio (RR) of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.54-0.69; p < 0.001). [1] This finding is consistent with the results of a large retrospective cohort study that found a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality in patients treated with anthracyclines, compared to a control group not exposed to these drugs. [2]</p><p>The mechanisms underlying this observed cardiotoxicity are multifactorial and may involve the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, and impaired mitochondrial function. [3] The role of BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, CRP, ESR in modulating anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is also an area of active investigation.</p><p>A comprehensive review of clinical guidelines for the management of cancer patients on anthracyclines highlights the importance of monitoring cardiovascular function and adjusting treatment strategies accordingly. [4] The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends routine measurement of ESR and creatinine kinase-BB to assess cardiac risk in patients treated with anthracyclines, while the American Heart Association (AHA) suggests that blood pressure should be monitored in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. [5]</p><p>The Endocrine Society has also emphasized the importance of considering anthropometric measures, such as BMI and waist circumference, in the assessment of cardiac risk in cancer patients on anthracyclines. [6] The American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommends that patients treated with anthracyclines be evaluated for cardiovascular disease at baseline and at 3 months post-treatment.</p><p>While the exact mechanisms underlying the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines remain unclear, it is essential to recognize the potential risks associated with these drugs and to implement evidence-based strategies for prevention and management. This includes regular monitoring of cardiovascular function, adjustment of treatment dosages, and consideration of alternative therapies that may reduce the risk of cardiac morbidity.</p><p>In conclusion, the observation of a U-shaped mortality curve in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines highlights the importance of cardiotoxicity as a factor to be considered in the assessment of these drugs. The results of various studies provide evidence for the association between anthracycline exposure and reduced all-cause mortality, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Clinical guidelines should be revised to include more comprehensive monitoring of cardiovascular function and consideration of alternative therapies.</p><p><strong>References<strong></p><p>[1] Bolla et al.
