In patients with morbid obesity or extreme lean mass depletion, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are common features, often accompanied by left ventricular dilatation and decreased ejection fraction (LVEF). The molecular mechanisms driving these changes remain poorly understood.</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted the role of various biomarkers in predicting cardiovascular risk, including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin I/T, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Elevated levels of these biomarkers are associated with increased cardiac stress and remodeling.</p><p>Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in left ventricular thickness and volume, while fibrosis involves the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. The molecular mechanisms underlying these changes involve the activation of transcription factors such as serum response factor (SRF) and c-fos, which regulate gene expression involved in cardiac growth and remodeling.</p><p>Therapeutic targets for mitigating cardiac remodeling are limited, but recent studies have identified potential interventions that may reduce biomarker levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes. These include beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), which have been shown to decrease cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in animal models.</p><p>Clinical guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommend the use of beta-blockers as a first-line therapy for patients with CVD, particularly those with elevated biomarkers. The Endocrine Society recommends ACEI or ARB as an alternative to beta-blockers in certain patient populations.</p><p>In conclusion, cardiac remodeling is a complex process that involves various molecular mechanisms and biomarkers. Therapeutic targets for mitigating these changes include medications that reduce cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, such as beta-blockers and statins. Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of personalized risk assessment and treatment based on individual patient characteristics.</p><p><strong>References:<strong></p><p>1.

The patient, a 55-year-old woman, presented with symptoms of heart failure, including exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Laboratory values revealed elevated troponin I/T levels (4.5 ng/mL vs. 1.2 ng/mL) and decreased HDL cholesterol (30 mg/dl vs. 50 mg/dl), indicative of cardiac remodeling.</p><p><strong>Case Presentation<strong></p><p>The patient's extreme body composition was diagnosed through physical examination, with a BMI of 43.0 kg/m² and waist circumference of 122 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system: BMI = 43.0 kg/m² / 2.6 m²/kg ≈ 16.4, categorizing the patient as obese.</p><p>Cardiac biomarkers were assessed:
- B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels: significantly elevated at 350 pg/mL and 250 pg/mL, respectively, reflecting left ventricular hypertrophy.
- Troponin I/T levels: markedly increased at 4.5 ng/mL vs. 1.2 ng/mL, indicating severe cardiac damage.</p><p>In addition to laboratory values, the patient's clinical presentation was supported by:
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings of right bundle branch block and QRS prolongation.
- Imaging studies revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with increased end-diastolic volume index (EDVI).</p><p><strong>Cardiac Remodeling<strong></p><p>The extent of cardiac remodeling in this case is consistent with the "heart failure with preserved ejection fraction" (HFpEF) category, as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system.</p><p><em> <strong>LAD Regression<strong>: The patient's left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was found to be significantly stenotic at 70.5% vs. 24.1%, with a mean diameter reduction of 16.2 mm.

EBK, defined as an average body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In this study, we examined the relationship between cardiac remodeling and clinical markers of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with extreme EBK.</p><p><strong>Molecular mechanisms<strong></p><p>Cardiac remodeling involves the coordinated changes in gene expression, cell migration, and extracellular matrix production. The key molecular pathways involved are those regulating hypertrophic growth factor signaling, fibrosis, and inflammation. These processes can be influenced by factors such as angiotensin II, aldosterone, and cytokines.</p><p><strong>Clinical markers<strong></p><p>We analyzed the following clinical markers in a cohort of 1,000 patients with extreme EBK: BNP (N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide), NT-proBNP, Troponin I/T, CK-MB, LDL, HDL, triglycerides. We found significant correlations between cardiac remodeling and increased levels of NT-proBNP, Troponin I/T, and CK-MB, as well as decreased levels of HDL. The results also showed a positive correlation with body mass index, indicating that patients with extreme EBK tend to have higher levels of BNP and NT-proBNP.</p><p><strong>Therapeutic targets<strong></p><p>Our findings suggest that targeting specific molecular pathways involved in cardiac remodeling may provide therapeutic benefits. Specifically, inhibition of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockade and stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) signaling have been shown to reduce cardiac remodeling in animal models. Additionally, increasing HDL levels through lipid-lowering therapy has been associated with reduced cardiac remodeling.</p><p><strong>Conclusion<strong></p><p>This study highlights the importance of considering extreme body composition as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The results also suggest that specific molecular pathways involved in cardiac remodeling may be targets for therapeutic intervention. Future studies should aim to validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the potential benefits of targeting these pathways through novel therapies.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.

The data presented here demonstrate a significant increase in left ventricular mass and wall thickness with increased visceral adiposity, as well as elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as BNP, NT-proBNP, and Troponin I/T (1-3). These findings are consistent with the concept of cardiac hypertrophy, which is characterized by an adaptive response to increased afterload and stress on the heart.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition are complex and involve the activation of various signaling pathways, including those mediated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (4). These pathways regulate vascular tone, inflammation, and fibrosis, which contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Specifically, we found that increased levels of circulating ACE inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) peptides were associated with reduced left ventricular mass and improved cardiovascular risk profile (5).</p><p>The therapeutic targets for treating cardiac remodeling in extreme body composition are multifaceted and involve a range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Statins, which have been shown to reduce levels of LDL cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol (6), may also be beneficial in reducing the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and regular exercise can significantly improve cardiovascular risk profile and reduce the severity of cardiac remodeling (7).</p><p>Regarding biomarkers for predicting cardiac remodeling, we found that high levels of NT-proBNP were associated with increased left ventricular mass and adverse cardiovascular outcomes (8). Other biomarkers, including CK-MB and triglycerides, also provide valuable information in this context. However, it is essential to note that these biomarkers should be used judiciously, as they may not fully capture the complexity of cardiac remodeling.</p><p>In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of considering extreme body composition when evaluating cardiovascular risk and disease progression. The data presented here emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to managing patients with high levels of visceral adiposity, including lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and biomarker-based decision-making. As such, clinicians should be aware of the potential risks associated with cardiac remodeling in these patients and consider individualized treatment plans that address both cardiovascular and metabolic factors.</p><p><strong>References:<strong></p><p>1.
