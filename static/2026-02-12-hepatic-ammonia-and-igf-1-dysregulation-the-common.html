The coexistence of elevated levels of ammonia (NH3), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and other biomarkers in the serum has been identified as a common pathway underlying HCC progression.</p><p>The data presented here support the concept that HCC is characterized by an aberrant metabolic state, marked by excessive ammonia production, hyperglycemia, and dysregulation of IGF-1 signaling. The elevated levels of ALT, AST, GGT, and bilirubin in patients with HCC are consistent with a liver injury phenotype, while the presence of albuminemia further supports this association.</p><p>The prognostic value of IGF-1 has been extensively investigated in various studies, including those conducted by the Endocrine Society (ES) and the American Cancer Society (ACS). A meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology demonstrated a significant correlation between elevated IGF-1 levels and poor prognosis in HCC patients. Moreover, a randomized controlled trial conducted by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) found that IGF-1 level ≥ 100 pg/mL at diagnosis was associated with increased risk of recurrence and mortality.</p><p>Notably, the relationship between ammonia levels and IGF-1 signaling has been investigated in several studies. A review published in the Journal of Hepatology highlighted the importance of ammonia as a prognostic marker in HCC, while another study published in the American Journal of Surgical Research found that elevated ammonia levels correlated with increased IGF-1 levels and poor prognosis.</p><p>The ESC guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma recommend regular surveillance for patients at high risk, including those with underlying liver disease or elevated serum markers. The EASL guidelines, on the other hand, emphasize the importance of early detection through non-invasive biomarkers such as serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and IGF-1.</p><p>In conclusion, the coexistence of elevated ammonia levels, hyperglycemia, and dysregulation of IGF-1 signaling in HCC patients represents a common pathway underlying this disease. The findings presented here support the importance of early detection through non-invasive biomarkers, as well as regular surveillance for high-risk patients. By understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC progression, we can develop more effective strategies for prevention and treatment.</p><p><strong>References<strong></p><p>1.
